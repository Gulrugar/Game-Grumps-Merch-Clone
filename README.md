### Cart Page
The cart page has all the things you would expect to find like prices and images of your cart items as well as any associated details like variant information. A unique featured implemented in this cart page however is the addition of a clear cart button that makes a call to the Cart Update API and removes all of the cart items and then reloads the page.
